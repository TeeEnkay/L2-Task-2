## Importance of an online make-up store.

As a woman myself, i have great understanding of how much a day of a woman let alone a mom can get handfull and you still need/want to look good. It takes time to prepare so saving time in just a few clicks and getting the product of one's choice delivered to their door step can bring the best and make life easier.

## Installation Tee's beauty shop

The website can only be used in a _local environment_ for now until further development can be done on the web site. This is because the application is not hosted on a web server (it may be hosted on a server in the future). For now users can download the site folder that includes the accompanying resources (JavaScript and CSS files)

For developers: You can contribute to this project by _**Forking**_ the project on github from this link https://github.com/TeeEnkay/L2-Task-2 Then as a developer you can clone the forked project in your local environment and later on be able to create a pull request to contribute. The project uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No npm libraries have been used in the development of the project so far hence no installations to the local environment are necessary.

To see the project in action, you just need to open the index.html file by double clicking on it to open it and start using the website. You need to be connect to the internet to pull the bootstrap styles that make the app looks and feels good!

NOTE: You need to have a web browser installed in your computer to be able to open the web page. Examples of popular web browsers include Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox and Internet Explorer.
